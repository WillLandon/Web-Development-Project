            <ul>
                <li>Use Active Recall while studying </li>
                 <p>- Instead of rereading, close your notes and try to explain the topic from memory. This strengthens long term retention because your brain is forced to retrieve information rather than just recognize it.</p>
            <br></br>
                 <li>Space out your studying over multiple days</li>
                 <p>- Studying the same material in small sessions across the week helps your brain store it more permanently. Cramming might help short term, but spacing boosts long term memory massively.</p>
            <br></br>
                 <li>Do practice problems</li>
                 <p>- Try a few problems, then read why the correct answers are right. Switching between doing and understanding prevents you from memorizing patterns instead of concepts.</p>
            <br></br>
                 <li>Study the same idea more than one way</li>
                 <p>- If you read something once, review it again by watching a video, making flashcards, or teaching it out loud. Your brain remembers things better when it sees them in different forms.</p>
             <br></br>
                <li>Go back to the info after a day</li>
                <p>- Your memory drops sharply after a day, so a quick reread or quiz the next day locks the information in. Even 10 minutes can make a big difference.</p>
